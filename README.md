For Backend:
Open a new terminal and navigate to the directory where your backend code is located by using the cd command followed by the correct file path.
Once you're in the correct directory, start the server by running the command node server.js.
If you're using Nodemon for automatic server restarts, use the command nodemon server.js instead.
Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed by running npm install before starting the server.

For Frontend:
To start the React application, open a new terminal, navigate to the directory where your React project is located using the cd command, and then run the command npm start to launch the development server.
